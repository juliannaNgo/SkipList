# SkipList

A node based implementation of the Java List interface, where retreiving items are done through a ladder-like data structure composed of nodes.

The following methods are implemented:

1. boolean add(E e)
2. void add(int index, E element)
3. E get (int index)
4. String toString() (see Java API: AbstractCollection)
5. int size()
